-> Dependencies: (1) numpy >= '1.21.5' 	(2) cv2 >= 3.0.0
-> open file astar_path_planner.py in the folder
-> run file and enter start and goal coordinates
-> sample input 1 : start(10,40); goal = (560,40) -- Results in folder "test case 1"
-> sample input 2 : start(5,5); goal = (200,200)  -- Results in folder "test case 2"
-> code generates required files 'astar_viz.avi' to animate node exploration and to show optimal path taken
